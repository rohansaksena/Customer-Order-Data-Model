## About this Repo
In this project we will be writing several queries to analyse the customer-order-data-model to develop a strong grasp over several topics of SQL.<br/>
We would be writing queries under several categories namely:
* single entity
* one to many
* many to many
* regular expressions
* general queries
<br/>
The difficulty of queries increase with each category.
